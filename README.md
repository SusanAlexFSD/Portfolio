💼 React Portfolio Website

A personal Portfolio Website built using React, created to showcase my journey and progress as a Full‑Stack Developer.
This project is a work in progress — the core functionality is in place, but the visual design and frontend polish are still being developed as I continue refining my skills.


✨ Project Overview

This portfolio serves as a central hub for all my full‑stack development projects.
Throughout my learning journey, I focused heavily on backend logic, APIs, databases, and functionality — the areas I found most challenging and wanted to master first.

Now that the backend concepts feel more solid, I’m returning to each project to improve the frontend aesthetics, accessibility, and overall user experience.
